[Stanford Intensive Neuroscience Bootcamp](https://med.stanford.edu/neurogradprogram/prospective_students/bootcamp.html) is taught each Fall to incoming first-year Neuroscience PhD students. I was a teaching assistant for the two-week-long course in 2018. As a TA, I taught cellular processes driving neuronal activity, single-cell patch electrophysiology in brain slices, and molecular biology tools and concepts. I also built the patch electrophysiology rigs.
