I am a PhD Candidate in Neurosciences at Stanford University. I study how our sensory systems predict based on past information. I am advised by [Tom Clandinin](https://flyvisionlab.weebly.com) and [Shaul Druckmann](https://www.druckmannlab.com/).

I am also an avid [musician](misc/music), and have performed throughout my life as a pianist, violinist, singer, and conductor. 

I am passionate about scientific, especially statistical, literacy. I support data- and statistics-driven policy making.
