I sing in the [Stanford Chamber Chorale](https://chorale.stanford.edu/). In the past, I have sung with [Princeton University Glee Club](https://princetongleeclub.com/), [Princeton University Chamber Choir](https://princetongleeclub.com/chamber-choir/), [Princeton University Chapel Choir](http://www.princetonchapelchoir.com/), and [Contrapunctus XIV](https://www.facebook.com/ContrapunctusXIV/).

I have been fortunate to have worked with very talented musicians as their conductor. I served as the student conductor of Princeton University Glee Club, co-directed Contrapunctus XIV, a student-run group focusing on early music, and twice directed [Princeton Opera Company](https://opera.princeton.edu/) shows. For four summers, I founded and directed Princeton University Summer Singers and Stanford Summer Chorale, consisting of community members and student researchers seeking musical outlets during otherwise-quiet university summers. Please enjoy recordings from some of my performances.
