Our brains are capable of making predictions about our sensory world based on their previous experiences. This capacity guides our behaviors to be more efficient and, in some cases, is crucial for survival. To understand how a brain can make such computations, I study visual prediction in fruit flies using systems and computational neuroscience.  

My past research included modeling DNA methylation as a dynamic process with important developmental consequences ([Laird Lab](http://depts.washington.edu/lairdlab/) and [Stöger Lab](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/biosciences/people/reinhard.stoger)) and studying how neuronal circuitry shapes fruit fly courtship behavior ([Murthy Lab](https://murthylab.princeton.edu/)).
